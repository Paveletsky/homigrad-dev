; Here's where you put advertisements
;
; Whether an advertisement is a center advertisement (csay) or text box advertisement (tsay) is determined by
; whether or not the "time_on_screen" key is present. If it is present, it's a csay.
;
; The 'time' argument inside a center advertisement and the number following a chat advertisement are the
; time it takes between each showing of this advertisement in seconds. Set it to 300 and the advertisement
; will show every five minutes.
;
; If you want to make it so that one advertisement is shown and then will always be followed by another,
; put them in a table. For example, if you add the following to the bottom of the file, A will always show
; first followed by B.
